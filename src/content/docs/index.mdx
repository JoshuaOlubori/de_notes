## What You'll Find Here

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Foundations" icon="open-book">
    Core concepts, failure modes, and the mission of data engineering. Understand what data engineering actually solves and why most pipelines fail.
  </Card>
  <Card title="OLTP vs OLAP" icon="seti:db">
    Deep dive into transactional and analytical workloads. Learn when to use each and how to migrate between them.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Batch vs Streaming" icon="rocket">
    Navigate the latency spectrum. Understand when batch is sufficient and when streaming is essential.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Postmortem Analysis" icon="warning">
    Learn from real production failures. Five detailed case studies covering schema evolution, cascade failures, and data loss.
  </Card>
  <Card title="And much more" icon="puzzle">
    A lot of stuff is covered.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>


## Philosophy

<Card title="Data Engineering is About Trade-offs" icon="information">
Every architectural decision involves sacrificing something: consistency for availability, latency for cost, flexibility for governance, simplicity for capability. These notes focus on understanding *when* to make each trade-off, not memorizing the "right" answer.

**Core Principles:**
- Failure is the teacher—more wisdom lives in postmortems than in product documentation
- Context is everything—Netflix's architecture is wrong for your startup
- Simple systems fail less—complexity is a liability that must justify its cost
- Data quality compounds—invest early or pay forever
- Observability is non-negotiable—if you can't see it breaking, you can't fix it
</Card>

## How to Use These Notes

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Read Sequentially" icon="list-format">
    Start with Module 1 (Foundations) and progress through the modules in order. Each builds on concepts from previous modules.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use as Reference" icon="magnifier">
    Jump directly to specific topics when you need them. Each module is self-contained with practical examples.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Learn from Failures" icon="error">
    Pay special attention to the war stories and postmortem analyses. Real production failures teach more than theoretical concepts.
  </Card>
